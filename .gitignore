# This .gitignore file is optimized for a personal Flutter practice repository.
# It is designed to ignore all platform-specific and generated build files,
# keeping the repository lean with only the essential Dart code and configuration.

# --- Core Flutter and IDE files to always ignore ---
# These are generated files and local settings that you should never commit.
.DS_Store               # macOS specific
.idea/                  # IntelliJ/Android Studio project settings
.vscode/                # VS Code project settings
.dart_tool/             # Dart build tool files
.flutter-plugins        # Generated plugin registry
.flutter-plugins-dependencies
.pub-cache/             # Downloaded pub packages (only a local cache)
.pub/                   # Pub internal files
/build/                 # All Flutter build output
*.iml                   # IntelliJ module files
*.lock                  # Lock files generated by various tools

# --- Temporary and Debugging files to always ignore ---
*.log
*.swp                   # vim temporary files
*.pyc                   # Python temporary files (for some dependencies)
**/doc/api/             # Generated API documentation
app.*.symbolsa
app.*.map.json
android/captures/
local.properties        # Contains local machine paths

# --- EXPLICITLY IGNORE PLATFORM-SPECIFIC FOLDERS ---
# Since this is a personal practice repo and you want a clean view,
# we will ignore all the major platform folders and the pubspec.lock file.
# Your code will still work locally, but these files will not be on GitHub.
# IMPORTANT: If you ever want this to be a runnable project for others,
# you must remove these lines.

android/                # The entire Android project
ios/                    # The entire iOS project
linux/                  # The entire Linux project
macos/                  # The entire macOS project
web/                    # The entire Web project
windows/                # The entire Windows project
pubspec.lock            # The file that locks dependency versions. Ignoring this is okay for a single-person repo.
